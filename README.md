RESTful Flask Web Scraper API backend: [https://github.com/nilu-24/leetcode-scraper-api](https://github.com/nilu-24/leetcode-scraper-api)

Lately, I’ve been grinding some leetcode problems and I decided to create an application which enhances the problem solving process and makes it more effective.

LeetDoc is an online IDE where you have the following features:

🕶️ Dark Theme: Perhaps the most important feature, a dark theme is a must to save your eyes.

⏳ Timer: A sticky timer to always keep track of time when solving problems.

🎨 Drawing Pad: It is very important to visualize your approach and draw it out. 

🗒️ Notepad: To make notes about your approach, runtime, edge cases etc.

📄 Google Docs-ish Editor: To get used to interview-styled coding, using no syntax highlighting or autocomplete. You can even run your code and debug etc. Build your coding muscle memory!

🌐 Helpful Links: If you’re stuck for a long time, see the solution, learn the process, and move on…

I will add more features soon and if you have any ideas please share!

If you’re struggling with technical interview preparation, keep the grind up, be patient, take care of yourselves and maintain consistency. You got this!
